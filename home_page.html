      This application allows people to more quickly and efficiently receive the
      proper medical attention they need. Being fueled by a sizeable medical
      database, holding information about almost all diseases, the application
      is trained to figure out what potential dangers you might be exposed to,
      and also to keep track of your medical history, enabling you to make
      better decisions regarding your health.

    <div class="home_description">
      All you have to do is to press the "Go To Tracker" button at the top of
      the page and enter your year of birth and gender in the given boxes. Then
      you will be asked a series of questions which will eventually conclude
      your diagnosis. This will then be saved into you "Tracking History", where
      all of your diagnoses will be stored.

    <div class="home_description">
      There are lots of people who go to the doctor for seemingly the silliest
      of reasons, like a mundane migraine or a mild pollen allergy. For these
      people, this app can prove itself to be very useful. Not only that, but it
      also makes medicine all the more accesible to as many people as possible,
      by launching the app as a free browser web application, that anyone with a
      simple device can access.
